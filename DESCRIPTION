Description: Provides tools for robust nonlinear curve fitting, supporting 
    power-law, exponential, and logarithmic models. The package integrates a 
    C++ backend for efficient optimization and implements multiple loss 
    functions (L1, L2, and Huber). A cross-validation framework automatically 
    selects the best loss function for a given dataset. S3 methods are 
    included for model fitting, printing, summarizing, and visualization, 
    with extensive input validation to ensure reliability.
